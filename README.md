The data folder holds the batter_data.csv file that has all of the data needed for the main file.

The data generation file is not meant to be run as it is simply to show the code I used to extract the batter_data stats from both the lahman and statcast data sets.

Sabermetrics Stat Creation file is the main file that can be ran to see the stat in action. It is important to note that my stat ended up being quite terrible so I had to pivot to a different use for my stat which I beleive fits it better.
